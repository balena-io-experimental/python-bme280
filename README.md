## A simple Python IoT code with BME280 sensor

This is a simple project that prints the data from the BME280 sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi running [balena](https://balena.io).

The sensor BME280 is a low-cost environmental sensor that senses temperature, humidity and pressure and can be easily connected to a Raspberry Pi or other devices.

### Getting started

* Raspberry Pi 3, 4 or balenaFin.
* BME280 sensor

* A balenaCloud account ([sign up here](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/))
* [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)

Once all of this is ready, you are able to deploy this repository following instructions below.

### Connect the hardware

To connect the BME280 with the Raspberry Pi follow this diagram connections below:
